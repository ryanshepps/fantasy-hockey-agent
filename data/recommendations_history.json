    "body": "*Week 2 Streaming Strategy (Oct 18-26)*\n\nYour roster is exceptionally strong with mostly elite and mid-tier talent that should be held. However, I identified one clear streaming opportunity to maximize games played.\n\n*STREAMING STRATEGY*\n\n*Priority Stream:*\n- *Drop:* Andrei Svechnikov (CAR - 4 games, only 5.5 fantasy points)\n- *Pickup:* Nick Schmaltz (UTA - 5 games remaining, 42.5 fantasy points)\n- *Timing:* Drop Svechnikov after tonight's game (Oct 18), pickup Schmaltz for tomorrow\n- *Games Gained:* +2 games (6 total vs 4 if keeping Svechnikov)\n\nSvechnikov has been ice cold with minimal production (5.5 points) while CAR only has 4 games. Schmaltz is red hot with 42.5 points and Utah has 5 games including 4 in the heavy week.\n\n*ALTERNATIVES*\n\nIf Schmaltz gets claimed, backup options (all provide +1-2 games):\n- *Conor Garland* (VAN - 5 games, 28.5 points) - solid floor with Vancouver's good schedule\n- *Zachary Bolduc* (MTL - 5 games, 33.5 points) - hot streak rookie\n- *Jason Zucker* (BUF - 5 games, 30.0 points) - veteran consistency\n- *Morgan Barron* (WPG - 5 games, 32.0 points) - getting quality minutes\n\n*NOTES*\n\n- Your core roster (Makar, Marchand, Bedard, Meier, etc.) should all be held regardless of schedule\n- Consider Dougie Hamilton as a potential drop candidate only if you find elite talent available - his 14.0 points are concerning for a top-4 defenseman\n- JJ Peterka could be rotational but has similar games to most streamers\n- Keep an eye on waiver wire for any surprise drops from other managers\n\n*Schedule Highlights:*\n- *Best:* EDM (6 games), multiple teams with 5 games\n- *Avoid:* CHI (3 games), several teams with only 4 games\n\nTarget teams with 5+ games for any additional pickups throughout the week."

    "body": "*Week 3 Streaming Strategy (Oct 19-26)*\n\nBased on my analysis of your roster and this week's schedule, I'm recommending the same high-value streaming move from last week since both players are still available.\n\n*STREAMING STRATEGY*\n\n*Priority Stream (SAME AS LAST WEEK):*\n- *Drop:* Andrei Svechnikov (CAR - still only 5.5 fantasy points, 3 games remaining)\n- *Pickup:* Nick Schmaltz (UTA - 42.5 fantasy points, 4 games remaining)\n- *Timing:* Drop Svechnikov after tonight's game (Oct 19), pickup Schmaltz tomorrow (Oct 20)\n- *Games Gained:* +2 games (5 total vs 3 if keeping Svechnikov)\n- *Next Schmaltz Game:* Oct 21 vs COL\n\nThis is the exact same recommendation as last week because:\n- Svechnikov continues to be ice cold (5.5 points in 5 games = 1.1 PPG)\n- Schmaltz remains red hot and available (42.5 points = 8.5 PPG)\n- Utah has an excellent 5-game schedule with 4 games remaining\n- CAR only has 3 games left this week\n\n*ALTERNATIVES*\n\nIf Schmaltz gets claimed before you can pick him up:\n\n- *Conor Garland* (VAN - 28.5 points, 4 games remaining) - Solid veteran with Vancouver's 5-game schedule\n- *Zachary Bolduc* (MTL - 33.5 points, 3 games remaining) - Hot rookie, though only +1 game advantage  \n- *Jason Zucker* (BUF - 30.0 points, 3 games remaining) - Consistent veteran, +1 game advantage\n- *Dawson Mercer* (NJ - 26.5 points, 4 games remaining) - Young talent on your own team (Devils)\n\n*NOTES*\n\n- Your core roster remains elite and should all be held (Makar, Marchand, Bedard, Meier, etc.)\n- Dougie Hamilton (14.0 points) could be considered droppable for elite talent, but his 4-game schedule isn't bad\n- Vasilevskiy (5.5 points) is also droppable but goalies are harder to stream effectively\n- Consider that Marchessault is currently injured (O status) which creates roster flexibility\n\n*Schedule Highlights:*\n- *Best:* EDM, UTA, VAN (5 games each)\n- *Good:* Multiple teams with 4 games  \n- *Avoid:* CAR, CHI, multiple teams with only 3 games\n\nThe fact that this same streaming opportunity exists two weeks in a row suggests both players may have been overlooked by other managers. Strike while the iron is hot!"

    "body": "*Week 3/4 Streaming Strategy (Oct 20 - Nov 2)*\n\nLooking at your roster and the upcoming 2-week schedule, I notice that you successfully picked up Nick Schmaltz from my previous recommendations - excellent work! He's been outstanding with 42.5 fantasy points.\n\nHowever, I have identified a few streaming opportunities to maximize games played over these two weeks.\n\n*STREAMING STRATEGY*\n\n*Priority Goalie Stream:*\n- *Drop:* Andrei Vasilevskiy (TB - 5.5 fantasy points, only 6 games over 2 weeks)\n- *Pickup:* Jake Allen (NJ - 30.0 fantasy points, 8 games over 2 weeks)  \n- *Timing:* Drop Vasilevskiy immediately (Oct 20), pickup Allen for tomorrow's game\n- *Games Gained:* +2 games (8 total vs 6 if keeping Vasilevskiy)\n- *Next Allen Game:* Oct 21 vs TOR\n\nThis is a clear upgrade both in production (30.0 vs 5.5 points) and schedule advantage. Vasilevskiy has been terrible with only 1.1 PPG while Allen has been much more reliable at 6.0 PPG.\n\n*ALTERNATIVES*\n\nIf Jake Allen gets claimed, other goalie options:\n- *Alex Lyon* (BUF - 54.0 points, 7 games) - Hot goalie with Buffalo's solid schedule\n- *Tristan Jarry* (PIT - 35.0 points) - Wait until Oct 27, then pickup for 4 games  \n- *Daniel Vladar* (PHI - 30.0 points) - Similar timing to Jarry\n\n*Forward Options (Less Priority):*\nSince your forward group is mostly elite talent, I only recommend these if you find exceptional opportunity:\n- *Evgeni Malkin* (PIT - 45.0 points, 7 games) - If available, he's elite talent\n- *Josh Doan* (BUF - 37.5 points, 7 games) - Hot rookie with good schedule\n\n*NOTES*\n\n- Your core roster remains elite and should be held (Makar, Marchand, Bedard, etc.)\n- Dougie Hamilton (15.0 points, 3.0 PPG) was flagged as droppable but NJ has 8 games - consider only for elite pickups\n- Brock Boeser is DTD which creates potential roster flexibility\n- Teams with best schedules: CGY, NJD, SJS (8 games each)\n- Avoid: CHI, FLA, VGK (only 5 games each)\n\n*The key insight: Vasilevskiy has been fantasy poison this season (1.1 PPG) while several backup goalies are outperforming him significantly. This is a no-brainer swap that gives you better production AND more games.*\n\nMake the Vasilevskiy \u2192 Allen swap immediately to maximize value!"

    "body": "*Week 3/4 Streaming Strategy (Oct 21 - Nov 2)*\n\nExcellent news! Your Nick Schmaltz pickup has paid off handsomely - he's now up to 52.0 fantasy points and continues to be a great hold. However, I've identified two clear streaming opportunities to maximize games played over the next two weeks.\n\n*STREAMING STRATEGY*\n\n*Priority 1: Forward Stream (IMMEDIATE ACTION)*\n- *Drop:* Andrei Svechnikov (CAR - 8.0 fantasy points, only 5 games over 2 weeks)\n- *Pickup:* Dawson Mercer (NJ - 33.0 fantasy points, 8 games over 2 weeks)\n- *Timing:* Drop Svechnikov TODAY (Oct 21), pickup Mercer immediately\n- *Games Gained:* +3 games (8 total vs 5 if keeping Svechnikov)\n- *Next Mercer Game:* TODAY Oct 21 @ TOR\n\nThis is a no-brainer move. Svechnikov has been terrible (1.6 PPG) while Mercer is producing at 6.6 PPG. Plus New Jersey has the best schedule with 8 games including tonight's game.\n\n*Priority 2: Goalie Stream (STILL VALID)*\n- *Drop:* Andrei Vasilevskiy (TB - 5.5 fantasy points, 6 games over 2 weeks)\n- *Pickup:* Jake Allen (NJ - 30.0 fantasy points, 8 games over 2 weeks)\n- *Timing:* Drop Vasilevskiy today, pickup Allen for tonight's game\n- *Games Gained:* +2 games (8 total vs 6 if keeping Vasilevskiy)\n- *Next Allen Game:* TODAY Oct 21 @ TOR\n\nSame recommendation as last week - Vasilevskiy continues to be fantasy poison (1.1 PPG) while Allen has been much more reliable at 6.0 PPG.\n\n*ALTERNATIVES*\n\nIf Dawson Mercer gets claimed first, other NJ/SJ options (8 games each):\n- *Jeff Skinner* (SJ - 29.0 points) - Veteran consistency\n- *Connor Brown* (NJ - 27.5 points) - Solid depth option\n- *Will Smith* (SJ - 25.0 points) - Rookie with upside\n\nIf Jake Allen gets claimed, backup goalie options:\n- *Jet Greaves* (CBJ - 23.5 points, 7 games) - Young goalie with opportunity\n- *Elvis Merzlikins* (CBJ - 21.5 points, 7 games) - Experience in Columbus tandem\n\n*NOTES*\n\n- Teams with best schedules: NJD, SJS (8 games each), then BOS/CBJ/CGY/COL/DAL/DET/EDM/LAK/NSH (7 games each)\n- Teams to avoid: VGK (4 games), CAR/CHI/FLA/MTL/NYR/SEA (5 games each)\n- Your core roster remains elite and should be held (Makar, Marchand, Bedard, Tage, Meier, Guentzel, etc.)\n- Brock Boeser is DTD which may create additional roster flexibility\n- Both streaming moves target players with games TODAY, so immediate action is recommended\n\n*The key insight: Both Svechnikov and Vasilevskiy have been major disappointments this season while better options with superior schedules are readily available. These aren't just schedule plays - they're quality upgrades too.*\n\nMake both moves immediately to capture maximum value starting with tonight's games!"

    "body": "*Week 3/4 Streaming Strategy (Oct 22 - Nov 2)*\n\nExcellent work on your previous streaming moves! Your *Nick Schmaltz pickup* has been phenomenal - he's now up to 63.0 fantasy points and is easily outperforming the players you've dropped. However, the current landscape presents fewer obvious streaming opportunities compared to previous weeks.\n\n*STREAMING STRATEGY*\n\n*Priority Move: Goalie Upgrade (MODERATE URGENCY)*\n- *Drop:* Andrei Vasilevskiy (TB - 5.5 fantasy points, 6 games over 2 weeks)\n- *Pickup:* Jake Allen (NJ - 40.5 fantasy points, 7 games over 2 weeks)\n- *Timing:* Drop Vasilevskiy after TB's next few games, pickup Allen to maximize NJ's 7-game schedule\n- *Games Gained:* +1 game (7 total vs 6 if keeping Vasilevskiy)\n- *Performance Upgrade:* Massive improvement from 1.1 PPG to 8.1 PPG\n\nThis move is less about schedule advantage (only +1 game) and more about *quality upgrade*. Vasilevskiy has been fantasy poison this season while Allen has been reliable and productive.\n\n*ALTERNATIVES*\n\nIf Jake Allen gets claimed, other goalie options with equal or better schedules:\n- *Alex Lyon* (BUF - 57.0 points, 6 games) - Hot goalie, currently the best fantasy performer\n- *Daniel Vladar* (PHI - 39.5 points, 6 games) - Solid option with Philadelphia's decent schedule\n- *Elvis Merzlikins* (CBJ - 35.0 points, 6 games) - Experience, though Columbus struggles\n\n*Forward Options (Lower Priority):*\nSince your forward group is mostly elite, only consider these if you find exceptional opportunity:\n- *Pavel Zacha* (BOS - 47.0 points, 6 games) - Strong producer on a good Boston team\n- *Conor Garland* (VAN - 46.0 points, 6 games) - Consistent veteran with solid schedule\n- *Justin Brazeau* (PIT - 54.5 points, 6 games) - Hot pickup if available\n\n*NOTES*\n\n- Your core roster remains elite and should all be held regardless of schedule\n- *Teams with best schedules:* CGY, DET, NJD, SJS (7 games each)\n- *Solid schedules:* Most teams have 6 games, making streaming less advantageous than previous weeks\n- *Avoid:* SEA, VGK, FLA (only 4 games each)\n- Brock Boeser remains injured (O status) which creates roster flexibility if needed\n\n*KEY INSIGHT*\n\nThis week presents fewer obvious streaming opportunities because most teams have similar game totals (6 games). The Vasilevskiy situation remains the clearest move - he's been consistently poor while better goalie options exist. \n\n*Your successful Nick Schmaltz pickup (63.0 points!) shows the value of quality streaming moves. Focus on upgrading weak spots rather than chasing marginal schedule advantages.*\n\nThe goalie position offers the best upgrade opportunity, but don't force moves just for the sake of activity. Your roster is strong overall."

    "body": "*Week 3/4 Streaming Strategy (Oct 23-Nov 2)*\n\nGreat news! Your *Nick Schmaltz pickup* continues to be phenomenal - he's now up to 63.0 fantasy points and remains a must-hold. However, this week presents a challenging streaming environment with fewer obvious opportunities compared to previous weeks.\n\n*STREAMING STRATEGY*\n\n*Priority Move: Defenseman Upgrade (MODERATE URGENCY)*\n- *Drop:* Radko Gudas (ANA - 27.0 fantasy points, only 5 games over 2 weeks)\n- *Pickup:* Boone Jenner (CBJ - 39.5 fantasy points, 6 games over 2 weeks)\n- *Timing:* Drop Gudas after tonight's game (Oct 23), pickup Jenner immediately\n- *Games Gained:* +2 games (7 total vs 5 if keeping Gudas)\n- *Next Jenner Game:* Tomorrow Oct 24 vs WSH\n\nThis is a quality upgrade from a struggling defenseman (4.5 PPG) to a productive forward (6.6 PPG) with better schedule. Columbus has 6 games including 4 in the heavy week, while Anaheim only has 5 total.\n\n*Secondary Goalie Situation:*\n- *Vasilevskiy remains problematic* (5.5 points, 1.4 PPG) but goalies are harder to stream\n- *Jake Allen (NJ)* and *Dan Vladar (PHI)* are available with 6-game schedules\n- Only consider if you need goalie starts for minimums\n\n*ALTERNATIVES*\n\nIf Boone Jenner gets claimed, backup options with +2 game advantage:\n- *Dmitri Voronkov* (CBJ - 39.0 points) - Same Columbus schedule, power forward\n- *Brenden Dillon* (NJ - 34.5 points) - Devils defenseman with hits/blocks upside\n- *Connor Brown* (NJ - 32.5 points) - Veteran forward on Devils' solid schedule\n- *Jeff Skinner* (SJ - 32.0 points) - San Jose has the best schedule (7 games total)\n\n*Lower Priority Forward Options:*\nSince your forward core is elite, only consider for exceptional opportunity:\n- *Justin Brazeau* (PIT - 54.5 points) - Hot streak player if available\n- *Pavel Zacha* (BOS - 47.0 points) - Proven producer on good Boston team\n- *Conor Garland* (VAN - 46.0 points) - Consistent veteran with decent schedule\n\n*NOTES*\n\n- Your core roster remains elite and should be held regardless of schedule\n- *Best schedules:* SJS (7 games), then most teams with 6 games\n- *Avoid teams:* FLA, MTL, SEA, VGK (only 4 games each)\n- The streaming landscape is less favorable this week - most teams have similar game totals\n- Dougie Hamilton (24.0 points, 3.4 PPG) was flagged as droppable but NJ has 6 games\n- JJ Peterka (24.0 points) could be streamed but UTA only has 5 games\n\n*KEY INSIGHT*\n\nThis two-week period offers fewer streaming advantages because most teams have 5-6 games, making the schedule differences less dramatic. The Gudas situation is the clearest upgrade opportunity - he's been underperforming on a weak Anaheim team with a poor schedule.\n\n*Your successful streaming moves (Schmaltz at 63.0 points!) show the value of targeting quality players with good schedules. Focus on the clear upgrade rather than forcing marginal moves.*\n\nThe Gudas \u2192 Jenner swap provides both better production and +2 games, making it the week's best streaming opportunity."
