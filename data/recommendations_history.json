    "body": "*Week 2 Streaming Strategy (Oct 18-26)*\n\nYour roster is exceptionally strong with mostly elite and mid-tier talent that should be held. However, I identified one clear streaming opportunity to maximize games played.\n\n*STREAMING STRATEGY*\n\n*Priority Stream:*\n- *Drop:* Andrei Svechnikov (CAR - 4 games, only 5.5 fantasy points)\n- *Pickup:* Nick Schmaltz (UTA - 5 games remaining, 42.5 fantasy points)\n- *Timing:* Drop Svechnikov after tonight's game (Oct 18), pickup Schmaltz for tomorrow\n- *Games Gained:* +2 games (6 total vs 4 if keeping Svechnikov)\n\nSvechnikov has been ice cold with minimal production (5.5 points) while CAR only has 4 games. Schmaltz is red hot with 42.5 points and Utah has 5 games including 4 in the heavy week.\n\n*ALTERNATIVES*\n\nIf Schmaltz gets claimed, backup options (all provide +1-2 games):\n- *Conor Garland* (VAN - 5 games, 28.5 points) - solid floor with Vancouver's good schedule\n- *Zachary Bolduc* (MTL - 5 games, 33.5 points) - hot streak rookie\n- *Jason Zucker* (BUF - 5 games, 30.0 points) - veteran consistency\n- *Morgan Barron* (WPG - 5 games, 32.0 points) - getting quality minutes\n\n*NOTES*\n\n- Your core roster (Makar, Marchand, Bedard, Meier, etc.) should all be held regardless of schedule\n- Consider Dougie Hamilton as a potential drop candidate only if you find elite talent available - his 14.0 points are concerning for a top-4 defenseman\n- JJ Peterka could be rotational but has similar games to most streamers\n- Keep an eye on waiver wire for any surprise drops from other managers\n\n*Schedule Highlights:*\n- *Best:* EDM (6 games), multiple teams with 5 games\n- *Avoid:* CHI (3 games), several teams with only 4 games\n\nTarget teams with 5+ games for any additional pickups throughout the week."
