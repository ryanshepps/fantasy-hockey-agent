    "body": "*Week 2 Streaming Strategy (Oct 18-26)*\n\nYour roster is exceptionally strong with mostly elite and mid-tier talent that should be held. However, I identified one clear streaming opportunity to maximize games played.\n\n*STREAMING STRATEGY*\n\n*Priority Stream:*\n- *Drop:* Andrei Svechnikov (CAR - 4 games, only 5.5 fantasy points)\n- *Pickup:* Nick Schmaltz (UTA - 5 games remaining, 42.5 fantasy points)\n- *Timing:* Drop Svechnikov after tonight's game (Oct 18), pickup Schmaltz for tomorrow\n- *Games Gained:* +2 games (6 total vs 4 if keeping Svechnikov)\n\nSvechnikov has been ice cold with minimal production (5.5 points) while CAR only has 4 games. Schmaltz is red hot with 42.5 points and Utah has 5 games including 4 in the heavy week.\n\n*ALTERNATIVES*\n\nIf Schmaltz gets claimed, backup options (all provide +1-2 games):\n- *Conor Garland* (VAN - 5 games, 28.5 points) - solid floor with Vancouver's good schedule\n- *Zachary Bolduc* (MTL - 5 games, 33.5 points) - hot streak rookie\n- *Jason Zucker* (BUF - 5 games, 30.0 points) - veteran consistency\n- *Morgan Barron* (WPG - 5 games, 32.0 points) - getting quality minutes\n\n*NOTES*\n\n- Your core roster (Makar, Marchand, Bedard, Meier, etc.) should all be held regardless of schedule\n- Consider Dougie Hamilton as a potential drop candidate only if you find elite talent available - his 14.0 points are concerning for a top-4 defenseman\n- JJ Peterka could be rotational but has similar games to most streamers\n- Keep an eye on waiver wire for any surprise drops from other managers\n\n*Schedule Highlights:*\n- *Best:* EDM (6 games), multiple teams with 5 games\n- *Avoid:* CHI (3 games), several teams with only 4 games\n\nTarget teams with 5+ games for any additional pickups throughout the week."

    "body": "*Week 3 Streaming Strategy (Oct 19-26)*\n\nBased on my analysis of your roster and this week's schedule, I'm recommending the same high-value streaming move from last week since both players are still available.\n\n*STREAMING STRATEGY*\n\n*Priority Stream (SAME AS LAST WEEK):*\n- *Drop:* Andrei Svechnikov (CAR - still only 5.5 fantasy points, 3 games remaining)\n- *Pickup:* Nick Schmaltz (UTA - 42.5 fantasy points, 4 games remaining)\n- *Timing:* Drop Svechnikov after tonight's game (Oct 19), pickup Schmaltz tomorrow (Oct 20)\n- *Games Gained:* +2 games (5 total vs 3 if keeping Svechnikov)\n- *Next Schmaltz Game:* Oct 21 vs COL\n\nThis is the exact same recommendation as last week because:\n- Svechnikov continues to be ice cold (5.5 points in 5 games = 1.1 PPG)\n- Schmaltz remains red hot and available (42.5 points = 8.5 PPG)\n- Utah has an excellent 5-game schedule with 4 games remaining\n- CAR only has 3 games left this week\n\n*ALTERNATIVES*\n\nIf Schmaltz gets claimed before you can pick him up:\n\n- *Conor Garland* (VAN - 28.5 points, 4 games remaining) - Solid veteran with Vancouver's 5-game schedule\n- *Zachary Bolduc* (MTL - 33.5 points, 3 games remaining) - Hot rookie, though only +1 game advantage  \n- *Jason Zucker* (BUF - 30.0 points, 3 games remaining) - Consistent veteran, +1 game advantage\n- *Dawson Mercer* (NJ - 26.5 points, 4 games remaining) - Young talent on your own team (Devils)\n\n*NOTES*\n\n- Your core roster remains elite and should all be held (Makar, Marchand, Bedard, Meier, etc.)\n- Dougie Hamilton (14.0 points) could be considered droppable for elite talent, but his 4-game schedule isn't bad\n- Vasilevskiy (5.5 points) is also droppable but goalies are harder to stream effectively\n- Consider that Marchessault is currently injured (O status) which creates roster flexibility\n\n*Schedule Highlights:*\n- *Best:* EDM, UTA, VAN (5 games each)\n- *Good:* Multiple teams with 4 games  \n- *Avoid:* CAR, CHI, multiple teams with only 3 games\n\nThe fact that this same streaming opportunity exists two weeks in a row suggests both players may have been overlooked by other managers. Strike while the iron is hot!"
