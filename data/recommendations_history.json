    "body": "*Week 2 Streaming Strategy (Oct 18-26)*\n\nYour roster is exceptionally strong with mostly elite and mid-tier talent that should be held. However, I identified one clear streaming opportunity to maximize games played.\n\n*STREAMING STRATEGY*\n\n*Priority Stream:*\n- *Drop:* Andrei Svechnikov (CAR - 4 games, only 5.5 fantasy points)\n- *Pickup:* Nick Schmaltz (UTA - 5 games remaining, 42.5 fantasy points)\n- *Timing:* Drop Svechnikov after tonight's game (Oct 18), pickup Schmaltz for tomorrow\n- *Games Gained:* +2 games (6 total vs 4 if keeping Svechnikov)\n\nSvechnikov has been ice cold with minimal production (5.5 points) while CAR only has 4 games. Schmaltz is red hot with 42.5 points and Utah has 5 games including 4 in the heavy week.\n\n*ALTERNATIVES*\n\nIf Schmaltz gets claimed, backup options (all provide +1-2 games):\n- *Conor Garland* (VAN - 5 games, 28.5 points) - solid floor with Vancouver's good schedule\n- *Zachary Bolduc* (MTL - 5 games, 33.5 points) - hot streak rookie\n- *Jason Zucker* (BUF - 5 games, 30.0 points) - veteran consistency\n- *Morgan Barron* (WPG - 5 games, 32.0 points) - getting quality minutes\n\n*NOTES*\n\n- Your core roster (Makar, Marchand, Bedard, Meier, etc.) should all be held regardless of schedule\n- Consider Dougie Hamilton as a potential drop candidate only if you find elite talent available - his 14.0 points are concerning for a top-4 defenseman\n- JJ Peterka could be rotational but has similar games to most streamers\n- Keep an eye on waiver wire for any surprise drops from other managers\n\n*Schedule Highlights:*\n- *Best:* EDM (6 games), multiple teams with 5 games\n- *Avoid:* CHI (3 games), several teams with only 4 games\n\nTarget teams with 5+ games for any additional pickups throughout the week."

    "body": "*Week 3 Streaming Strategy (Oct 19-26)*\n\nBased on my analysis of your roster and this week's schedule, I'm recommending the same high-value streaming move from last week since both players are still available.\n\n*STREAMING STRATEGY*\n\n*Priority Stream (SAME AS LAST WEEK):*\n- *Drop:* Andrei Svechnikov (CAR - still only 5.5 fantasy points, 3 games remaining)\n- *Pickup:* Nick Schmaltz (UTA - 42.5 fantasy points, 4 games remaining)\n- *Timing:* Drop Svechnikov after tonight's game (Oct 19), pickup Schmaltz tomorrow (Oct 20)\n- *Games Gained:* +2 games (5 total vs 3 if keeping Svechnikov)\n- *Next Schmaltz Game:* Oct 21 vs COL\n\nThis is the exact same recommendation as last week because:\n- Svechnikov continues to be ice cold (5.5 points in 5 games = 1.1 PPG)\n- Schmaltz remains red hot and available (42.5 points = 8.5 PPG)\n- Utah has an excellent 5-game schedule with 4 games remaining\n- CAR only has 3 games left this week\n\n*ALTERNATIVES*\n\nIf Schmaltz gets claimed before you can pick him up:\n\n- *Conor Garland* (VAN - 28.5 points, 4 games remaining) - Solid veteran with Vancouver's 5-game schedule\n- *Zachary Bolduc* (MTL - 33.5 points, 3 games remaining) - Hot rookie, though only +1 game advantage  \n- *Jason Zucker* (BUF - 30.0 points, 3 games remaining) - Consistent veteran, +1 game advantage\n- *Dawson Mercer* (NJ - 26.5 points, 4 games remaining) - Young talent on your own team (Devils)\n\n*NOTES*\n\n- Your core roster remains elite and should all be held (Makar, Marchand, Bedard, Meier, etc.)\n- Dougie Hamilton (14.0 points) could be considered droppable for elite talent, but his 4-game schedule isn't bad\n- Vasilevskiy (5.5 points) is also droppable but goalies are harder to stream effectively\n- Consider that Marchessault is currently injured (O status) which creates roster flexibility\n\n*Schedule Highlights:*\n- *Best:* EDM, UTA, VAN (5 games each)\n- *Good:* Multiple teams with 4 games  \n- *Avoid:* CAR, CHI, multiple teams with only 3 games\n\nThe fact that this same streaming opportunity exists two weeks in a row suggests both players may have been overlooked by other managers.

    "body": "*Week 3/4 Streaming Strategy (Oct 20 - Nov 2)*\n\nLooking at your roster and the upcoming 2-week schedule, I notice that you successfully picked up Nick Schmaltz from my previous recommendations - excellent work! He's been outstanding with 42.5 fantasy points.\n\nHowever, I have identified a few streaming opportunities to maximize games played over these two weeks.\n\n*STREAMING STRATEGY*\n\n*Priority Goalie Stream:*\n- *Drop:* Andrei Vasilevskiy (TB - 5.5 fantasy points, only 6 games over 2 weeks)\n- *Pickup:* Jake Allen (NJ - 30.0 fantasy points, 8 games over 2 weeks)  \n- *Timing:* Drop Vasilevskiy immediately (Oct 20), pickup Allen for tomorrow's game\n- *Games Gained:* +2 games (8 total vs 6 if keeping Vasilevskiy)\n- *Next Allen Game:* Oct 21 vs TOR\n\nThis is a clear upgrade both in production (30.0 vs 5.5 points) and schedule advantage. Vasilevskiy has been terrible with only 1.1 PPG while Allen has been much more reliable at 6.0 PPG.\n\n*ALTERNATIVES*\n\nIf Jake Allen gets claimed, other goalie options:\n- *Alex Lyon* (BUF - 54.0 points, 7 games) - Hot goalie with Buffalo's solid schedule\n- *Tristan Jarry* (PIT - 35.0 points) - Wait until Oct 27, then pickup for 4 games  \n- *Daniel Vladar* (PHI - 30.0 points) - Similar timing to Jarry\n\n*Forward Options (Less Priority):*\nSince your forward group is mostly elite talent, I only recommend these if you find exceptional opportunity:\n- *Evgeni Malkin* (PIT - 45.0 points, 7 games) - If available, he's elite talent\n- *Josh Doan* (BUF - 37.5 points, 7 games) - Hot rookie with good schedule\n\n*NOTES*\n\n- Your core roster remains elite and should be held (Makar, Marchand, Bedard, etc.)\n- Dougie Hamilton (15.0 points, 3.0 PPG) was flagged as droppable but NJ has 8 games - consider only for elite pickups\n- Brock Boeser is DTD which creates potential roster flexibility\n- Teams with best schedules: CGY, NJD, SJS (8 games each)\n- Avoid: CHI, FLA, VGK (only 5 games each)\n\n*The key insight: Vasilevskiy has been fantasy poison this season (1.1 PPG) while several backup goalies are outperforming him significantly. This is a no-brainer swap that gives you better production AND more games.*\n\nMake the Vasilevskiy \u2192 Allen swap immediately to maximize value!"

However, I've identified two clear streaming opportunities to maximize games played over the next two weeks.\n\n*STREAMING STRATEGY*\n\n*Priority 1: Forward Stream (IMMEDIATE ACTION)*\n- *Drop:* Andrei Svechnikov (CAR - 8.0 fantasy points, only 5 games over 2 weeks)\n- *Pickup:* Dawson Mercer (NJ - 33.0 fantasy points, 8 games over 2 weeks)\n- *Timing:* Drop Svechnikov TODAY (Oct 21), pickup Mercer immediately\n- *Games Gained:* +3 games (8 total vs 5 if keeping Svechnikov)\n- *Next Mercer Game:* TODAY Oct 21 @ TOR\n\nThis is a no-brainer move. Svechnikov has been terrible (1.6 PPG) while Mercer is producing at 6.6 PPG. Plus New Jersey has the best schedule with 8 games including tonight's game.\n\n*Priority 2: Goalie Stream (STILL VALID)*\n- *Drop:* Andrei Vasilevskiy (TB - 5.5 fantasy points, 6 games over 2 weeks)\n- *Pickup:* Jake Allen (NJ - 30.0 fantasy points, 8 games over 2 weeks)\n- *Timing:* Drop Vasilevskiy today, pickup Allen for tonight's game\n- *Games Gained:* +2 games (8 total vs 6 if keeping Vasilevskiy)\n- *Next Allen Game:* TODAY Oct 21 @ TOR\n\nSame recommendation as last week - Vasilevskiy continues to be fantasy poison (1.1 PPG) while Allen has been much more reliable at 6.0 PPG.\n\n*ALTERNATIVES*\n\nIf Dawson Mercer gets claimed first, other NJ/SJ options (8 games each):\n- *Jeff Skinner* (SJ - 29.0 points) - Veteran consistency\n- *Connor Brown* (NJ - 27.5 points) - Solid depth option\n- *Will Smith* (SJ - 25.0 points) - Rookie with upside\n\nIf Jake Allen gets claimed, backup goalie options:\n- *Jet Greaves* (CBJ - 23.5 points, 7 games) - Young goalie with opportunity\n- *Elvis Merzlikins* (CBJ - 21.5 points, 7 games) - Experience in Columbus tandem\n\n*NOTES*\n\n- Teams with best schedules: NJD, SJS (8 games each), then BOS/CBJ/CGY/COL/DAL/DET/EDM/LAK/NSH (7 games each)\n- Teams to avoid: VGK (4 games), CAR/CHI/FLA/MTL/NYR/SEA (5 games each)\n- Your core roster remains elite and should be held (Makar, Marchand, Bedard, Tage, Meier, Guentzel, etc.)\n- Brock Boeser is DTD which may create additional roster flexibility\n- Both streaming moves target players with games TODAY, so immediate action is recommended\n\n*The key insight: Both Svechnikov and Vasilevskiy have been major disappointments this season while better options with superior schedules are readily available. These aren't just schedule plays - they're quality upgrades too.*\n\nMake both moves immediately to capture maximum value starting with tonight's games!"

Your *Nick Schmaltz pickup* has been phenomenal - he's now up to 63.0 fantasy points and is easily outperforming the players you've dropped. However, the current landscape presents fewer obvious streaming opportunities compared to previous weeks.\n\n*STREAMING STRATEGY*\n\n*Priority Move: Goalie Upgrade (MODERATE URGENCY)*\n- *Drop:* Andrei Vasilevskiy (TB - 5.5 fantasy points, 6 games over 2 weeks)\n- *Pickup:* Jake Allen (NJ - 40.5 fantasy points, 7 games over 2 weeks)\n- *Timing:* Drop Vasilevskiy after TB's next few games, pickup Allen to maximize NJ's 7-game schedule\n- *Games Gained:* +1 game (7 total vs 6 if keeping Vasilevskiy)\n- *Performance Upgrade:* Massive improvement from 1.1 PPG to 8.1 PPG\n\nThis move is less about schedule advantage (only +1 game) and more about *quality upgrade*. Vasilevskiy has been fantasy poison this season while Allen has been reliable and productive.\n\n*ALTERNATIVES*\n\nIf Jake Allen gets claimed, other goalie options with equal or better schedules:\n- *Alex Lyon* (BUF - 57.0 points, 6 games) - Hot goalie, currently the best fantasy performer\n- *Daniel Vladar* (PHI - 39.5 points, 6 games) - Solid option with Philadelphia's decent schedule\n- *Elvis Merzlikins* (CBJ - 35.0 points, 6 games) - Experience, though Columbus struggles\n\n*Forward Options (Lower Priority):*\nSince your forward group is mostly elite, only consider these if you find exceptional opportunity:\n- *Pavel Zacha* (BOS - 47.0 points, 6 games) - Strong producer on a good Boston team\n- *Conor Garland* (VAN - 46.0 points, 6 games) - Consistent veteran with solid schedule\n- *Justin Brazeau* (PIT - 54.5 points, 6 games) - Hot pickup if available\n\n*NOTES*\n\n- Your core roster remains elite and should all be held regardless of schedule\n- *Teams with best schedules:* CGY, DET, NJD, SJS (7 games each)\n- *Solid schedules:* Most teams have 6 games, making streaming less advantageous than previous weeks\n- *Avoid:* SEA, VGK, FLA (only 4 games each)\n- Brock Boeser remains injured (O status) which creates roster flexibility if needed\n\n*KEY INSIGHT*\n\nThis week presents fewer obvious streaming opportunities because most teams have similar game totals (6 games). The Vasilevskiy situation remains the clearest move - he's been consistently poor while better goalie options exist. \n\n*Your successful Nick Schmaltz pickup (63.0 points!) shows the value of quality streaming moves. Focus on upgrading weak spots rather than chasing marginal schedule advantages.*\n\nThe goalie position offers the best upgrade opportunity, but don't force moves just for the sake of activity. Your roster is strong overall."

Columbus has 6 games including 4 in the heavy week, while Anaheim only has 5 total.\n\n*Secondary Goalie Situation:*\n- *Vasilevskiy remains problematic* (5.5 points, 1.4 PPG) but goalies are harder to stream\n- *Jake Allen (NJ)* and *Dan Vladar (PHI)* are available with 6-game schedules\n- Only consider if you need goalie starts for minimums\n\n*ALTERNATIVES*\n\nIf Boone Jenner gets claimed, backup options with +2 game advantage:\n- *Dmitri Voronkov* (CBJ - 39.0 points) - Same Columbus schedule, power forward\n- *Brenden Dillon* (NJ - 34.5 points) - Devils defenseman with hits/blocks upside\n- *Connor Brown* (NJ - 32.5 points) - Veteran forward on Devils' solid schedule\n- *Jeff Skinner* (SJ - 32.0 points) - San Jose has the best schedule (7 games total)\n\n*Lower Priority Forward Options:*\nSince your forward core is elite, only consider for exceptional opportunity:\n- *Justin Brazeau* (PIT - 54.5 points) - Hot streak player if available\n- *Pavel Zacha* (BOS - 47.0 points) - Proven producer on good Boston team\n- *Conor Garland* (VAN - 46.0 points) - Consistent veteran with decent schedule\n\n*NOTES*\n\n- Your core roster remains elite and should be held regardless of schedule\n- *Best schedules:* SJS (7 games), then most teams with 6 games\n- *Avoid teams:* FLA, MTL, SEA, VGK (only 4 games each)\n- The streaming landscape is less favorable this week - most teams have similar game totals\n- Dougie Hamilton (24.0 points, 3.4 PPG) was flagged as droppable but NJ has 6 games\n- JJ Peterka (24.0 points) could be streamed but UTA only has 5 games\n\n*KEY INSIGHT*\n\nThis two-week period offers fewer streaming advantages because most teams have 5-6 games, making the schedule differences less dramatic. The Gudas situation is the clearest upgrade opportunity - he's been underperforming on a weak Anaheim team with a poor schedule.\n\n*Your successful streaming moves (Schmaltz at 63.0 points!) show the value of targeting quality players with good schedules.

Both teams have 4 games, but this is purely about getting a functioning goalie.\n\n*ALTERNATIVES*\n\nIf Justin Brazeau gets claimed first, backup forward options (all with 4+ games):\n- *Dmitri Voronkov* (CBJ - 57.5 points, 4 games) - Power forward with excellent production\n- *Pavel Zacha* (BOS - 54.0 points, 4 games) - Proven veteran on good Boston team  \n- *Anthony Mantha* (PIT - 48.5 points, 4 games) - Same Pittsburgh schedule as Brazeau\n- *Will Smith* (SJ - 45.5 points, 5 games) - Young talent with San Jose's excellent 5-game schedule\n\nIf Dan Vladar gets claimed, backup goalie options:\n- *Arturs Silovs* (PIT - 48.0 points, 4 games) - Hot backup with Pittsburgh's solid schedule\n- *Tristan Jarry* (PIT - 47.5 points, 4 games) - Same Pittsburgh schedule, veteran experience\n- *Elvis Merzlikins* (CBJ - 40.0 points, 4 games) - Columbus option with 4 games\n\n*Secondary Options:*\n- *Brock Boeser* (VAN - 27.5 points, 3.93 PPG) could be dropped for elite talent, but Vancouver has 4 games\n- *Anthony Stolarz* (TOR - 20.0 points, 2.86 PPG) is droppable but Toronto only has 3 games\n\n*NOTES*\n\n- Your core roster remains elite and should be held regardless of schedule (Makar, Marchand, Bedard, etc.)\n- *Best schedules:* CGY, NJD, SJS (5 games each) - target these teams if other options emerge\n- *Solid schedules:* Most teams have 4 games, making streaming less dramatic than previous weeks\n- *Avoid:* UTA, TOR, WSH (only 3 games each), FLA, MTL, SEA (only 2 games each)\n- Your successful Schmaltz pickup (77.0 points!) proves the value of targeting both quality and schedule\n\n*KEY INSIGHT*\n\nThis week offers two clear upgrades where better players with equal or better schedules are available. The Peterka situation is particularly compelling - he's been underwhelming on Utah's terrible 3-game schedule, while multiple elite options exist with 4+ games.\n\n*Your Nick Schmaltz success story (77.0 points from a streaming pickup!) shows the power of quality-focused moves. Both recommended swaps follow the same winning formula: significantly better players with equal or superior schedules.*\n\nThe Vasilevskiy upgrade is especially critical - he's been fantasy poison all season and needs to be replaced with a functional goalie immediately."

Vasilevskiy continues to be fantasy poison while Silovs has been much more reliable with Pittsburgh's excellent 8-game schedule.\n\n*Secondary Option: Forward Quality Upgrade (IF AVAILABLE)*\n- *Drop:* Anthony Stolarz (TOR - 20.0 points, 7 games over 2 weeks)\n- *Pickup:* Justin Brazeau (PIT - 60.5 points, 8 games over 2 weeks)\n- *Games Gained:* +1 game (8 total vs 7 if keeping Stolarz)\n- *Quality Upgrade:* 2.86 PPG \u2192 10.1 PPG (elite production!)\n\nThis would give you two goalies from different teams while adding a red-hot forward with the best schedule.\n\n*ALTERNATIVES*\n\nIf Arturs Silovs gets claimed, backup goalie options:\n- *Frederik Andersen* (CAR - 39.0 points, 7 games) - Veteran reliability with solid schedule\n- *Tristan Jarry* (PIT - 47.5 points, 8 games) - Same Pittsburgh schedule, proven starter\n\nIf Justin Brazeau gets claimed, other high-quality forwards:\n- *Blake Coleman* (CGY - 59.5 points, 7 games) - Power forward with excellent production  \n- *Pavel Zacha* (BOS - 54.0 points, 7 games) - Proven veteran on strong Boston team\n- *Jake Neighbours* (STL - 51.5 points, 8 games) - Young talent with top schedule\n- *Leo Carlsson* (ANA - 53.0 points, 7 games) - Elite prospect with solid opportunity\n\n*NOTES*\n\n- Your core roster remains elite and should be held regardless of schedule (Schmaltz, Guenther, Marchand, Makar, Tage, Guentzel, etc.)\n- *Best schedules:* PIT, STL (8 games each) - target these teams for maximum games\n- *Good schedules:* Most teams have 7 games, making this week less about dramatic advantages\n- *Avoid:* FLA, MTL, VGK (only 5 games each)\n- The schedule differences are smaller this week, so focus on quality upgrades over pure game count\n- Both your goalies are underperforming (Vasilevskiy at 2.92 PPG, Stolarz at 2.86 PPG)\n\n*KEY INSIGHT*\n\nThis two-week period is less about major roster overhauls and more about targeted quality improvements.

This two-week period presents a conservative streaming environment, as most teams have similar game totals (4-6 games), making schedule advantages less dramatic than previous weeks.\n\n*STREAMING STRATEGY*\n\nBased on our analysis, I'm recommending a conservative approach this week focusing on quality upgrades over pure schedule plays. The streaming opportunities are more limited but still valuable.\n\n*Priority Move 1: Goalie Quality Upgrade (MODERATE OPPORTUNITY)*\n- *Drop:* Andrei Vasilevskiy (TB - 38.0 points, 4 games over 2 weeks)\n- *Pickup:* Dan Vladar (PHI - 66.5 points, 5 games over 2 weeks)\n- *Timing:* Drop Vasilevskiy immediately (Oct 31), pickup Vladar for tomorrow's action\n- *Games Gained:* +1 game (5 total vs 4 if keeping Vasilevskiy)\n- *Next Vladar Game:* Nov 1 vs TOR\n- *Quality Upgrade:* Vasilevskiy continues to be fantasy poison while Vladar has been much more reliable\n\n*Priority Move 2: Forward Schedule Play (SOLID VALUE)*\n- *Drop:* Alex Ovechkin (WSH - 50.0 points, 5 games over 2 weeks)\n- *Pickup:* Troy Terry (ANA - 57.0 points, 6 games over 2 weeks)\n- *Timing:* Drop Ovechkin after Nov 1 game (after 2 games played), pickup Terry immediately\n- *Games Gained:* +2 games (7 total vs 5 if keeping Ovechkin)\n- *Next Terry Game:* Nov 2 vs NJD\n- *Quality & Schedule Upgrade:* Terry has better production AND Anaheim has the best schedule (6 games)\n\n*ALTERNATIVES*\n\nIf Dan Vladar gets claimed, backup goalie options with quality upgrades:\n- *Joey Daccord* (SEA - 63.0 points, 5 games) - Hot goalie with reliable production\n- *Arturs Silovs* (PIT - 57.0 points, 5 games) - Same Pittsburgh schedule as other targets\n\nIf Troy Terry gets claimed, other forwards with solid schedules:\n- *Justin Brazeau* (PIT - 77.5 points, 5 games) - Red-hot forward with excellent production\n- *Blake Coleman* (CGY - 63.0 points, 5 games) - Power forward with consistent output\n- *Marco Rossi* (MIN - 62.5 points, 5 games) - Young talent with strong opportunity\n\n*Conservative Options:*\nPavel Buchnevich (45.0 points) could be considered for streaming but only provides marginal gains (+1 game vs elite talent).\n\n*NOTES*\n\n- Your core roster remains elite and should be held regardless of schedule (Schmaltz, Makar, Bedard, Tage, etc.)\n- *Best schedule:* ANA (6 games) - clear target for streaming\n- *Solid schedules:* Most teams have 5 games, making this week less about dramatic advantages\n- *Avoid:* Teams with only 4 games (BOS, BUF, CBJ, EDM, FLA, LAK, MTL, NJD, NYR, OTT, TB, VGK, WPG)\n- Both recommended moves target players with superior production alongside schedule advantages\n\n*KEY INSIGHT*\n\nThis two-week period is less about major roster overhauls and more about strategic quality improvements. The Vasilevskiy situation presents the clearest upgrade opportunity - he's been consistently underperforming while better options exist.\n\n*Your Nick Schmaltz success at 101.0 points proves the value of patience and quality-focused moves. Both recommended swaps follow the same winning formula: better players with better schedules.*\n\nThe Anaheim connection (Troy Terry) is particularly compelling as they have the lone 6-game schedule, providing both immediate value and a schedule edge that's rare this week."

    "body": "*Week 5/6 Streaming Strategy (Nov 1-9)*\n\nFantastic work continuing your *Nick Schmaltz success story* - he's now at an incredible 101.0 fantasy points and remains your highest scorer! This two-week period presents a more conservative streaming environment, as most teams have similar game totals (4-5 games), making schedule advantages less dramatic than previous weeks.\n\n*STREAMING STRATEGY*\n\nThis week offers fewer obvious streaming advantages because most teams have similar game counts. However, I've identified one clear upgrade opportunity that provides both quality improvement and schedule benefit.\n\n*Priority Move: Goalie Quality Upgrade (CLEAR OPPORTUNITY)*\n- *Drop:* Andrei Vasilevskiy (TB - 38.0 points, only 4 games over 2 weeks)\n- *Pickup:* Dan Vladar (PHI - 66.5 points, 5 games over 2 weeks)\n- *Timing:* Drop Vasilevskiy immediately (Nov 1), pickup Vladar for tonight's action\n- *Games Gained:* +1 game (5 total vs 4 if keeping Vasilevskiy)\n- *Next Vladar Game:* TODAY Nov 1 vs TOR\n- *Quality Upgrade:* Massive improvement from struggling Vasilevskiy to reliable Vladar\n\nThis is both a schedule play AND a significant quality upgrade. Vasilevskiy continues to be fantasy poison while Vladar has been much more productive with Philadelphia's 5-game schedule.\n\n*ALTERNATIVES*\n\nIf Dan Vladar gets claimed, backup goalie options with quality upgrades:\n- *Joey Daccord* (SEA - 63.0 points, 5 games) - Hot goalie with reliable Seattle schedule\n- *Lukas Dostal* (ANA - 57.0 points, 5 games) - Anaheim netminder with solid opportunity \n- *Arturs Silovs* (PIT - 57.0 points, 5 games) - Pittsburgh backup with good schedule\n\n*Secondary Forward Options (Lower Priority):*\nSince your forward core is exceptionally strong, only consider if you find elite opportunity available:\n- *Justin Brazeau* (PIT - 77.5 points, 5 games) - Red-hot forward if somehow available\n- *Troy Terry* (ANA - 75.0 points, 5 games) - Quality veteran with solid Anaheim schedule\n- *Anthony Mantha* (PIT - 65.5 points, 5 games) - Pittsburgh depth with good schedule\n\n*NOTES*\n\n- Your core roster remains elite and should be held regardless of schedule (Schmaltz, Makar, Tage, Bedard, Guenther, etc.)\n- *Best schedules:* 15 teams have 5 games each - no major advantage to chase\n- *Solid schedules:* Most teams have 4-5 games, making this week less about dramatic streaming\n- *Avoid:* VGK (only 3 games)\n- The streaming landscape is less favorable this week due to similar game distributions\n- Pavel Buchnevich (45.0 points) could be considered for elite pickups but STL has 5 games\n\n*KEY INSIGHT*\n\nThis two-week period is less about major roster overhauls and more about targeted quality improvements. The Vasilevskiy situation presents the clearest upgrade opportunity - he's been consistently underperforming while better options with equal or superior schedules are readily available.\n\n*Your Nick Schmaltz success at 101.0 points proves the value of patience and quality-focused moves. The Vasilevskiy upgrade follows the same winning formula: better player with better schedule.*\n\nThe goalie position offers the best upgrade opportunity this week. Focus on the clear quality improvement rather than forcing marginal schedule moves. Your roster strength means you can be selective and target meaningful upgrades only."
